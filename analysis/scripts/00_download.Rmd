### Libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

### Data
Load English words from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words
```{r eval=FALSE}
download.file(url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwyl/english-words/master/words_alpha.txt',
              dest = '../../data/dwyl_words.txt')
```

### Analysis
```{r}
words <- read_delim('../../data/dwyl_words.txt', 
                    delim = '\n',
                    col_names = F) %>% 
  pull(X1)
words %>% head()
```
#### Five letter words
```{r}
fives <- words[nchar(words) == 5]
fives %>% head()
```

#### Remove plurals
```{r}
fours <- words[nchar(words) == 4]
fours %>% head()
```


```{r}
plurals <- paste0(fours, 's')
plurals %>% head()
```

```{r}
fives_plurals <- intersect(fives, plurals)
fives_plurals %>% head()
```

```{r}
fives_singular <- setdiff(fives, plurals)
fives_singular %>% head()
```
```{r}
fives_singular %>% length()
```

```{r}
fives_singular %>% write.table('../../data/fives_singular.tsv')
```
